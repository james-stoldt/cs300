CS-300 Week 8 Requirement

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This class required us to implement several of the most popular fundamental data structures and algorithms in Computer Science. The problems revolved around picking the most reasonable structures/algorithms for scenarios presented to us, which were mainly loading records from a flat file and processing them in some way.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
For the most part I just followed the instructions that were provided. It was very straightforward. Until week 6, decisions about which data structures to use were made for me. In week 7, I opted to use the built-in data structures/algorithms in the C++ STL because the assignment did not specify which implementation to use.

Understanding DS&A is important because that understanding drives decisions you'll be making when writing programs. I work with ERP/WMS software, so my whole life revolves around working with collections of data. I wouldn't be able to get very far if I didn't know how to pick the proper container for my data.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I didn't really have any major roadblocks. I referenced the textbook as necessary and did some light Googling when unsure about minor things (syntax, best practices, etc.)

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I came into this class with a high level understanding of fundamental DS&A. It was nice to actually take the time implementing them. My favorite part of programming is learning about the magic under the hood - eventually as you dive deeper and deeper, you learn there was never really any magic at all.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I can't honestly say this project has changed much about how I program. It was straightforward. The best thing about it was getting me back in the IDE - it's been some time since I had Visual Studio open. It kept me sharp.
